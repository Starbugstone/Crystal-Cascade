- Crystal Cascade runs on Vue 3 (Composition API) with Pinia state, Phaser 3 rendering, Howler audio, Vite tooling, and Capacitor 7 mobile builds—keep integrations aligned with this stack.
- Enforce clean architecture: SOLID boundaries between stores, engine modules, and Phaser utilities; favor DRY helpers and KISS-level abstractions over bespoke logic.
- Keep code readable, lint-friendly, and self-documenting with concise comments only where intent is non-obvious; avoid leaking globals or cross-layer coupling.
- Centralize and maintain all documentation in `.docs/`, updating it alongside features (technical reference, architecture decisions, changelog).
